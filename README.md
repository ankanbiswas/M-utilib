# M-utilib
Collection of useful MATLAB functions and snippets.

I made this repository to make available some code I made for myself which I think can be usefull to others.
Each function should work on its own and have different purposes from the others.
I'm trying to comment as much as possible in the source code, in order to make it easier to understand and modify it; anyway I'm going to write an example script for each function.
